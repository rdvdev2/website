      My interest in coding started when I was 10 years old, and I needed to learn <b>Lua</b> to play with the Minecraft
      Mod ComputerCraft. Since then, my curiosity has led me to explore and learn everything about programming that I
      can find and understand on the Internet. Although I have explored technologies such as <b>C++</b>, <b>OpenGL</b>,
      <b>Vulkan</b>, <b>HTML</b> or <b>Python</b>, I feel really comfortable with <b>Java</b> and <b>Rust</b>, and I try
      to develop my projects on those platforms. If I'm known for something, it is for my Minecraft mods, and thus I try
      to put a big effort on them and create quality content for the players.
      <br><br>
      On this web page, you will find all sort
      of <b>projects</b> and <b>devlogs</b> written by me. I hope you enjoy it, and maybe find some piece of wisdom that
      helps you on your current or future projects!
